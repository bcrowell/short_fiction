Each licensing option goes into effect a certain amount of time after
publication, and you get to choose from among the ones that are in
effect as of a certain date.  The period of exclusivity referred to
below is the one required by my contract with the magazine that first
published it: 1 month for Asimov's, 60 days for Strange Horizons, zero
for Baen's Universe. My contracts with Asimov's also state that I have
to maintain a notice saying that the story was originally published in
Asimov's, so please retain such a notice on all copies.

The Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license applies, once the exclusivity period is over.

The following license (based on a proposal by Cory Doctorow) also
applies after the exclusivity period. You are free to create
commercial works derived from this one, provided that you remit, on an
annual basis, 20 percent of the gross income arising from your sales
to Benjamin Crowell, 2233 Loma Alta Dr., Fullerton, CA 92833, USA.  As
a condition of this license, your work must prominently bear the
words: <i>This work is created under the terms of a self-service
license given at lightandmatter.com. Benjamin Crowell, the original
creator from whom this work is derived, has not reviewed or approved
it, though he is compensated for its sale.

In the spirit of the Creative Commons Founders' Copyright project, the
Creative Commons CC-Zero license applies, starting 28 years after
publication.
